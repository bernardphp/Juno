Juno
====

Juno provides a web interface for monitoring [Bernard](http://github.com/henrikbjorn/Bernard) and its queues.
Juno is built on top of [Flint](http://flint.rtfd.org) but can be used standalone by stacking it with
[stackphp](http://stackphp.org).

Juno uses inspiritas which is a bootstrap theme and therefore is completely responsive. It gives a great outlook
on your phone or tablet.

Getting Started
---------------

`web/index.php` contains an example where the Doctrine driver is used. It will insert some dummy data the first
time it is ran.

The configuration is found in `config/config.json` for the example.

For more information see the silex integration documentation together with `web/index.php`.
